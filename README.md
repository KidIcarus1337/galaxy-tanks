* Create a currency system that allows the purchasing of various weapons
* Implement a zoom in/out feature that allows various viewing distances of the game map
* Add slow-moving stars to the background
* Add the option for players to enter their own names
* Add various animations (i.e. player teleportation, explosions, shot trails, etc.)
* Add sound effects/music
* Implement true randomly-generated maps
* Polish (fine-tune the CSS, add custom fonts, apply textures to ships/planets/shots, add favicon, etc.)
* Optimize for various screen sizes and/or devices
